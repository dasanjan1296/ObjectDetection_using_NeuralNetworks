Instructions

*Step1* The "train.weights" file is a pre-trained database used for training. One can easily train the model with other datasets as well.
*Step2* Download the train.weights file from the link : "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bEZhZducP9i2QLAh69UiwsyHpapYtFEy/view?usp=sharing"
*Step3* In the command "data = BinaryReadList["train.weights", "Real32", Path -> "C:\\Users\\Anjan\\Desktop"][[5 ;; -1]];" , change the Path value to the path where the downloaded "train.weights" file from Step2 is present on your device.
*Step4* Rest of the demonstartion is present in the associated Mathematica notebook fil, viz. "NeuralNetworkObjectDetection.nb".
