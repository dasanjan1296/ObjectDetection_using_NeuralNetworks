The associated Mathematica notebook file, viz. "NeuralNetworkObjectDetection.nb", uses Neural Networks to detect objects in a given image and currently it can classify upto 20 objects in an image. It uses nine convolutional layers, which act as feature extractor, and three fully connected layers, which is used for predicting bounding boxes. Refer to "Instructions.md" to learn about how to use the Mathematica model for Object Detection.
Refer to "Description.md" for understanding how the model is constructed.
P.S. This approach uses Regression rather than clasification.
P.S. This was written in Wolfram Mathematica 11.2 and won't run on lower versions.
